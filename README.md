#Harry Potter Statistics Project - Code Academy Stream 2

You can view the project here: 

###Purpose and need of project

The project itself shows a variety of statistics related to the very popular book series 'Harry Potter'.
The purpose of the project is to show the user how many characters mentioned throughout the series meet 
the requirements set by the user. The user can easily find out, for example, how many characters were a
part of the 'Slytherin' House and were female. The application itself has a counter at the top that easily
displays the total amount of people that meet the specified criteria and the charts adjust as the user clicks
on them to portrait more data about the group of people shown by the number in the counter.
